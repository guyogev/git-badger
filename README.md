## About

GitBadger visualizes git repositories commit history statistics.
Unlike other great code statistics tools such as [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/vs-code-stats) & [codestats](https://codestats.net/), it doesn't require IDE integration. all the statistics are pull from the repositories git log.

It scans repositories git log, and generate a report page for every author that ever committed into master branch.

The report presents the author contribution and experience in the form of Graphs and achievement badges.

## So what does it mean

Absolutely nothing. It is just for fun. Please do not try to measure team performance using this tool.

## Badges
